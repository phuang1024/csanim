Fixing Bugs
-----------

You can look at the `bug issues <https://github.com/phuang1024/csanim/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Abug>`__
on GitHub. Those tagged with "good first issue" are recommended for
first-time contributors.

Alternatively, you can search for ``TODO`` or ``FIXME`` in the code files.
Those will usually be accompanied with a short description of what is to
be done.

New Features
------------

Issues with the `enhancement <https://github.com/phuang1024/csanim/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3Aenhancement>`__
label are suggestions for new features. Again, those tagged with
"good first issue" are recommended for new contributors.
